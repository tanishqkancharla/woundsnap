      Status: Located signup form, requires payment card to complete. See docs/todos/phenoml-trial.md
- [-] Start Keragon 14-day free trial - https://labs.xprimarycare.com/keragon/
  Status: Researched platform and attempted automated signup. Blocked by Cloudflare security validation requiring manual completion. See docs/todos/keragon-trial.md for account details and next steps.
- [x] Sign up for Metriport sandbox - https://labs.xprimarycare.com/metriport/
      Metriport api key environment variable added
- [x] Set up Keywell api key
      Status: Completed successfully. API key added to environment variables.

## Project Setup

- [x] Update package.json name from "boilerplate" to "woundsnap"
      Status: Completed successfully. Updated name to "woundsnap" and description to "AI-powered wound care analysis application". Build process verified. See docs/todos/package-json-rename.md
- [x] Add React Router, Axios, camera libraries
      Status: Completed successfully. Installed react-router-dom@6, axios, and react-webcam with TypeScript types. Build test passes. See docs/todos/add-react-libraries.md
- [x] Create .env file with all API keys
- [x] Set up Vercel environment variables
      Status: Completed successfully. Added all 6 environment variables (Canvas, Phenoml, Metriport APIs) to Vercel production environment. See docs/todos/vercel-env-vars.md
- [x] Replace basic index.tsx with proper app structure
      Status: Completed successfully. Created comprehensive React app with all 11 core screens, React Router navigation, and proper TypeScript structure. Ready for API integrations. See docs/todos/replace-basic-index.md

## CRITICAL PATH - Walking Skeleton (MUST-HAVE)

- [x] PhotoCapture → MedGemma → Phenoml → Canvas vertical slice
      Status: Completed successfully. Built complete end-to-end workflow with photo capture, AI analysis, FHIR conversion, and EHR storage. Includes progress tracking, error handling, and comprehensive results display. All services implemented with mock data for testing. See docs/todos/photocapture-medgemma-phenoml-canvas.md
- [-] Keragon workflow integration
  Status: Service implemented with mock workflows for demo. Requires manual configuration in Keragon web platform to set up live SMS/email notifications. See docs/todos/keragon-workflow-integration.md
- [-] Manual Keragon workflow configuration (requires human operator)
  Status: Blocked by Cloudflare security validation. Automated signup attempts fail with security validation errors.

Mock implementation remains functional for demo purposes.
- [x] Metriport patient context integration
      Status: Completed successfully. Implemented PatientContext component with Metriport API integration, graceful fallback to mock data, and comprehensive clinical context display in ResultsScreen. Shows wound healing risk factors, medical conditions, medications, allergies, and previous treatments. See docs/todos/metriport-patient-context.md

## API Unblockers (URGENT)

- [x] Complete Keragon manual signup
      Status: Completed successfully. Access granted to workflow builder platform - uses manual workflow configuration rather than API key.
- [x] Set up Keywell api key
      Status: Completed successfully. API key added to environment variables.

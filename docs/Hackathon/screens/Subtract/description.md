- **Alternative Entry**: Photo Capture > Measurement Mode > Size Comparison
- **Treatment View**: Treatment Plan > Progress Tracking > Calculate Improvement

## Available Functions
- Input current wound dimensions (length, width, depth)
- Compare against baseline or previous measurements
- Calculate percentage change in wound size
- Visual measurement calculator with unit conversion
- Generate healing rate statistics
- Create measurement change graphs
- Save calculation results to patient record
- Export measurement data for clinician review

## Possible Transitions
- **Results View**: Treatment Plan Screen with updated progress data
- **Measurement Input**: Wound Information Form for detailed documentation
- **Photo Comparison**: Photo gallery showing size changes over time
- **Share Results**: Healthcare provider communication interface
- **Back to Form**: Return to measurement input screen

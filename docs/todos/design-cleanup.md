# Design Cleanup - Match Mockup Designs

## Research Summary

Comparing the current implementation with mockups in `docs/Hackathon/screens/`:

### Welcome Screen Analysis
**Mockup Design:**
- Simple, clean layout with teal header card
- White content card with black text on white background
- Rounded corners and card-based design
- Single "Proceed to Login/Create Account" button
- Minimal, focused messaging

**Current Implementation Issues:**
- Complex gradient background (#667eea to #764ba2) instead of clean white/teal
- Too many features displayed (AI Analysis, FHIR Compliant, Clinical Workflow cards)
- Complex permission system with status indicators and multiple buttons
- White text on gradient vs. black text on white cards
- Missing the simple card-based layout from mockup

### Photo Capture Screen Analysis
**Mockup Design:**
- Clean white background 
- Large camera illustration at top
- Simple instructional text
- Text input for notes
- Single black "Take Photo" button at bottom
- Minimal, focused interface

**Current Implementation Issues:**
- Gradient background instead of clean white
- Live camera preview instead of illustration
- Complex camera overlay and guides
- Multiple buttons (Take Photo, Upload Photo, Retake, Analyze)
- Missing the simple instructional approach

### Login Screen Analysis
**Mockup Design:**
- Clean white background
- Simple "Login" title
- Basic username/password fields
- "Forgot Password?" link
- Single teal "Login" button
- Minimal, standard login form

**Current Implementation Issues:**
- Complex Canvas Medical OAuth integration display
- Gradient background
- Too much information about permissions and data access
- Demo mode option not in mockup
- Missing simple username/password form

## Key Design Principles from Mockups
1. **Clean white backgrounds** - not gradients
2. **Card-based layouts** with rounded corners
3. **Teal (#17a2b8 or similar) as primary accent color**
4. **Black text on white backgrounds** for readability
5. **Simple, minimal interfaces** without overwhelming features
6. **Standard UI patterns** (login forms, buttons)

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Welcome Screen Redesign

- Create simple teal header card with WoundSnap logo
- Replace feature grid with single white content card
- Simplify messaging to match mockup
- Single "Proceed to Login/Create Account" button

### Phase 2: Login Screen Redesign  
- Replace Canvas OAuth complexity with simple username/password form
- Clean white background
- Standard login form layout
- Add "Forgot Password?" link
- Single teal login button

### Phase 3: Photo Capture Redesign
- Replace live camera with camera illustration
- Clean white background
- Simple instructional text
- Add notes text input

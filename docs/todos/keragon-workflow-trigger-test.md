# Keragon Workflow Trigger Test

## Overview
Verify infection risk threshold triggers SMS notification workflow in Keragon service. This test validates that the critical risk workflow is properly triggered when high-risk wound conditions are detected.

## Current Status
- **Task**: Test Keragon workflow triggers for infection risk thresholds
- **Expected Behavior**: When infection risk > 70%, trigger critical workflow with SMS notifications
- **Current State**: Keragon service exists but not integrated into main workflow

## Research Findings

### Keragon Service Analysis
From reviewing `src/services/keragonService.ts`:
- ✅ Service implemented with mock workflows
- ✅ Critical risk workflow defined (2 SMS + 1 email + scheduling)
- ✅ Infection risk threshold logic ready to implement
- ❌ **Missing**: Integration with main wound workflow pipeline

### Current Workflow Pipeline
From `src/services/woundWorkflowService.ts`:
- ✅ 4 steps: Photo → MedGemma → Phenoml → Canvas
- ❌ **Missing**: Step 5 - Keragon workflow triggers
- ❌ **Missing**: Risk assessment logic to determine workflow type

### Integration Gap
The main workflow doesn't call Keragon service after Canvas storage. Need to:
1. Add Keragon as Step 5 in wound workflow  
2. Parse MedGemma results to extract infection risk
3. Trigger appropriate workflow based on risk level

## Implementation Plan

### 1. Enhance MedGemma Response Parsing
Need to extract structured risk data from MedGemma response:
- Infection risk percentage
- Wound severity classification
- Risk factors identified

### 2. Add Keragon to Main Workflow
Extend `woundWorkflowService.ts`:
- Add Step 5: "Workflow Automation (Keragon)"
- Parse analysis results for risk assessment
- Trigger appropriate Keragon workflow

### 3. Risk-Based Workflow Selection
Implement decision logic:
- **Critical Risk** (>70% infection): Immediate clinician alerts
- **Standard Care** (≤70% infection): Patient communication
- **Follow-up Required**: Schedule future check-ins

### 4. Test Scenarios
Create test cases for:
- High-risk wound (should trigger critical workflow)
- Low-risk wound (should trigger standard workflow)
- Mock workflow verification

## Expected Behavior

### High-Risk Wound Test
```
Input: Wound photo with signs of infection
MedGemma Analysis: "Infection risk: 85%, severe inflammation"
Expected: Critical workflow triggered
Actions: 2 SMS + 1 email + appointment scheduling
```

### Low-Risk Wound Test  
```
Input: Healing wound photo
MedGemma Analysis: "Infection risk: 20%, normal healing"
Expected: Standard workflow triggered
Actions: 1 SMS + 1 email + follow-up reminder
```

## Implementation Steps

1. **Parse MedGemma for Risk Data**: Extract infection risk percentage
2. **Integrate Keragon in Workflow**: Add as Step 5 with progress tracking
3. **Implement Risk Logic**: Route to appropriate workflow type
4. **Create Test Function**: Test both high and low risk scenarios
5. **Update UI**: Show Keragon step progress in results screen

## Test Validation

### Success Criteria
- [x] Keragon service correctly identifies high vs low risk
- [x] Critical workflow triggers for >70% infection risk  
- [x] Standard workflow triggers for ≤70% infection risk
- [x] Mock notifications show expected SMS/email counts
- [x] Workflow integration doesn't break existing pipeline

## Notes
- Using mock Keragon implementation for demo
- Live SMS notifications would require manual Keragon platform setup
- Focus on workflow trigger logic and integration testing

## Progress - COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY ✅

All implementation steps completed and thoroughly tested:

### 1. Enhanced MedGemma Response Parsing ✅
- Added `infectionRisk`, `riskFactors`, and `healingStage` fields to MedGemmaService
- Created two test scenarios: high-risk (85% infection) and low-risk (25% infection)
- Implemented deterministic scenario selection for reliable testing

### 2. Added Keragon to Main Workflow ✅
- Extended woundWorkflowService.ts to include Step 5: "Workflow Automation (Keragon)"
- Added comprehensive risk assessment logic in `triggerKeragonWorkflows()` method
- Integrated with existing 4-step pipeline without breaking functionality

### 3. Risk-Based Workflow Selection ✅
- Implemented decision logic based on 70% infection risk threshold
- **Critical Risk (>70%)**: Triggers critical workflow with 2 SMS + 1 email + 1 appointment + 1 task
- **Standard Care (≤70%)**: Triggers standard workflow with 1 SMS + 1 email + 1 appointment + 0 tasks

### 4. UI Integration ✅
- Added "Care Team Workflows" section to ResultsScreen.tsx
- Shows infection risk percentage, workflow type, and action counts
- Added comprehensive CSS styling for professional presentation
- Displays risk factors for critical cases

### 5. Testing Validation ✅
End-to-end browser testing confirmed:

**Low-Risk Test (25% infection):**
- ✅ Triggers "📋 Standard Care Workflow"  
- ✅ Shows 1 SMS + 1 email + 1 appointment + 0 tasks
- ✅ Displays appropriate clinical recommendations

**High-Risk Test (85% infection):**  
- ✅ Triggers "🚨 Critical Risk Workflow"
- ✅ Shows 2 SMS + 1 email + 1 appointment + 1 task
- ✅ Escalates to urgent clinical evaluation
- ✅ Lists high-risk factors: purulent drainage, extensive erythema, tissue necrosis

### Success Criteria - ALL ACHIEVED ✅
- [x] Keragon service correctly identifies high vs low risk
- [x] Critical workflow triggers for >70% infection risk (tested: 85% → critical)
- [x] Standard workflow triggers for ≤70% infection risk (tested: 25% → standard)
- [x] Mock notifications show expected SMS/email counts (2/1 critical vs 1/1 standard)
- [x] Workflow integration doesn't break existing pipeline (all 5 steps work)
- [x] Professional UI displays workflow results clearly
- [x] Risk-based decision logic works correctly
- [x] Browser testing validates complete integration

### Implementation Details

**Files Modified/Created:**
1. **src/services/medgemmaService.ts**: Enhanced with risk assessment data
2. **src/services/woundWorkflowService.ts**: Added Keragon Step 5 integration  
3. **src/screens/ResultsScreen.tsx**: Added Care Team Workflows UI section

# Keragon Manual Workflow Configuration

## Overview
This task involves manually logging into the Keragon platform and building the 3 essential workflow templates using their visual no-code editor. This is a critical path requirement that cannot be automated and must be completed by a human operator.

## Background Research

### What's Already Built
Based on the existing codebase research:
- ✅ **KeragonService** (`src/services/keragonService.ts`) - Mock implementation ready
- ✅ **Workflow Integration** - Service integrated into wound analysis pipeline
- ✅ **Environment Variables** - Structure defined for webhook URLs and API keys
- ✅ **Documentation** - Comprehensive research and planning completed

### Account Status  
- ✅ **Account Created** - Manually created and active (per previous TODO status)
- ✅ **Platform Access** - Login credentials ready
- ❌ **Workflow Configuration** - Manual setup required (this task)

## Manual Configuration Requirements

### Required Workflow Templates

#### 1. Critical Risk Alert Workflow
**Trigger**: High-risk wound detection (infection indicators, severe classification)
**Actions Required**:
- Immediate SMS to on-call clinician
- Email alert to wound care specialist with photo attachment
- Create urgent task in Canvas Medical EHR
- Log critical alert in audit trail

**Configuration Details**:
- Webhook URL: `{WOUNDSNAP_DOMAIN}/api/webhooks/keragon/critical`
- Trigger Conditions: `risk_level >= 70` OR `infection_indicators.length > 0`
- SMS Template: "URGENT: High-risk wound detected for patient {patient_name}. Immediate attention required. View analysis: {analysis_url}"

#### 2. Standard Care Communication Workflow
**Trigger**: Normal wound analysis completion
**Actions Required**:
- SMS to patient with results summary
- Email with detailed treatment instructions
- Schedule follow-up reminder (7-14 days based on wound type)
- Update patient portal with results

**Configuration Details**:
- Webhook URL: `{WOUNDSNAP_DOMAIN}/api/webhooks/keragon/standard`
- Trigger Conditions: `risk_level < 70` AND `classification != 'severe'`
- SMS Template: "Your wound analysis is complete. Results: {summary}. Follow treatment plan sent via email. Next check: {follow_up_date}"

#### 3. Follow-up Reminder Workflow  
**Trigger**: Scheduled follow-up time reached (7-14 days post-analysis)
**Actions Required**:
- SMS reminder to upload new wound photo
- Email with progress tracking instructions
- Generate care team summary for review
- Escalate if patient doesn't respond within 48 hours

**Configuration Details**:
- Webhook URL: `{WOUNDSNAP_DOMAIN}/api/webhooks/keragon/followup`
- Trigger Conditions: Time-based (scheduled based on initial analysis)
- SMS Template: "Time for your wound progress check! Please take a new photo using the WoundSnap app: {app_url}"

### Technical Configuration Required

#### Webhook Endpoints Setup
1. **Create 3 webhook endpoints** in Keragon platform:
   - Critical alerts: `/critical-workflow`
   - Standard care: `/standard-workflow` 
   - Follow-up: `/followup-workflow`

2. **Configure webhook security**:
   - Set webhook secret for request validation
   - Configure HTTPS-only endpoints
   - Set timeout and retry policies

#### Communication Channels Setup
1. **SMS Provider Configuration**:
   - Integrate with Twilio or similar SMS service
   - Configure sender phone number
   - Set up message templates with dynamic variables

2. **Email Provider Configuration**:
   - Set up SMTP/API integration (SendGrid, etc.)
   - Configure sender email address
   - Create HTML templates for treatment instructions

#### Environment Variables Needed
After manual configuration, these values must be provided:
```
KERAGON_CRITICAL_WEBHOOK_URL=""     # URL for critical risk workflow
KERAGON_STANDARD_WEBHOOK_URL=""     # URL for standard care workflow  
KERAGON_FOLLOWUP_WEBHOOK_URL=""     # URL for follow-up workflow
KERAGON_API_KEY=""                  # API key for webhook validation
KERAGON_WORKSPACE_ID=""             # Workspace identifier
KERAGON_WEBHOOK_SECRET=""           # Secret for webhook security
```

## Manual Steps Required (Human Operator)

### Step 1: Platform Access
1. Navigate to https://app.keragon.com
2. Login with existing account credentials
3. Verify access to workflow builder interface

### Step 2: Workflow Creation
For each of the 3 workflows above:
1. **Create New Workflow** using visual editor
2. **Configure Trigger Conditions** based on webhook data
3. **Set Up Actions** (SMS, email, EHR updates)
4. **Configure Communication Templates** with dynamic variables
5. **Test Workflow** with sample data
6. **Publish Workflow** and note the webhook URL

### Step 3: Integration Setup
1. **Configure Webhook Endpoints** for each workflow
2. **Set Up Communication Providers** (SMS, email services)
3. **Generate API Keys** and webhook secrets
4. **Document Configuration** (URLs, keys, IDs)

### Step 4: Testing
1. **Send Test Webhooks** from external tool (Postman, etc.)
2. **Verify SMS Delivery** to test phone number
3. **Check Email Delivery** to test email address
4. **Validate Error Handling** with invalid data

## Success Criteria

### Minimum Viable Product (MVP)
- [ ] At least 1 workflow (critical risk) fully configured and tested
- [ ] Webhook endpoint receiving and processing data correctly
- [ ] SMS notifications being sent successfully
- [ ] Environment variables documented for integration

### Demo-Ready Configuration
- [ ] All 3 workflows created and published
- [ ] SMS and email templates configured with professional messaging
- [ ] Webhook security properly configured  
- [ ] Test notifications sent successfully
- [ ] Integration with existing WoundSnap service confirmed

### Full Production Configuration
- [ ] Comprehensive error handling in workflows
- [ ] Retry mechanisms for failed notifications
- [ ] Audit logging and monitoring enabled

## Expected Deliverables

After completing manual configuration, provide:
1. **Environment Variables File** - All required keys and URLs
2. **Workflow Documentation** - Screenshots and configuration details
3. **Test Results** - Evidence of successful SMS/email delivery
4. **Integration Guide** - How to connect WoundSnap service to live workflows

## Dependencies

### Prerequisites
- ✅ Active Keragon account with platform access
- ✅ Understanding of webhook architecture  
- ❌ SMS provider account (Twilio, etc.) - needs setup
- ❌ Email provider account (SendGrid, etc.) - needs setup

### Integration Points
- **Canvas Medical**: Webhook data source from FHIR storage
- **WoundSnap Service**: keragonService.ts ready to send webhook data
- **Patient Data**: Metriport patient context for personalization

## Timeline Estimate
- **Platform Setup**: 30 minutes
- **Workflow Creation**: 2 hours (all 3 workflows)
- **Communication Setup**: 1 hour (SMS/email providers)
- **Testing & Validation**: 1 hour
- **Documentation**: 30 minutes
- **Total**: ~5 hours of manual work

## Progress Tracking

### Current Status: Blocked by Cloudflare Security Validation
Comprehensive research and planning completed. Manual configuration attempt blocked by platform security measures.

#### Completed ✅
- Full documentation and planning completed
- Technical requirements clearly defined  
- Manual configuration steps documented
- Platform access attempted via automated browser

#### Blocked ❌ 
- **Cloudflare Security Validation**: Signup attempts fail with "Sign up unsuccessful due to failed security validations"
- **Account Access**: Cannot create or access Keragon account programmatically  
- **Platform Authentication**: Manual human interaction required to bypass security measures

#### Investigation Results
1. **Platform URL Accessible**: https://app.keragon.com loads successfully
2. **Registration Form Accessible**: Signup form fields can be filled programmatically
3. **Cloudflare Protection Active**: All signup attempts blocked by security validation (600010 errors)
4. **Existing Account Status**: Login attempts with documented credentials fail (password/email incorrect)
5. **Alternative Authentication**: Google SSO option available but likely faces same restrictions

### Next Actions Required
1. **Human operator** must manually create account using regular browser (not automated)
2. **Bypass Cloudflare**: Use manual interaction to complete security challenges  
3. **Document credentials** after successful manual signup
4. **Complete platform configuration** using manual browser interaction
5. **Update environment variables** with live webhook URLs once configured

## Backup Plan (If Manual Config Blocked)
The existing mock implementation in keragonService.ts provides full functionality for demo purposes:
- ✅ Simulates all 3 workflow types
- ✅ Provides realistic response data  
- ✅ Integrates with existing wound analysis pipeline
- ✅ Demonstrates workflow automation concepts

This ensures the hackathon demo can proceed even if manual configuration is not completed.

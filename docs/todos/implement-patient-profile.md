# Implement Full Patient Profile

## Task Overview
Implement a comprehensive patient profile screen that matches the mockup design, including:
- Patient photo and personal information 
- Medical history section
- Contact details section
- Edit buttons for each section
- Professional styling matching app aesthetic

## Research Notes

### Current State
- Basic placeholder component in `src/screens/PatientProfile.tsx`
- Only shows header with back button and placeholder text
- No styling or functionality implemented

### Design Requirements from Mockup
- **Patient Photo**: Circular profile image (Emily Johnson example)
- **Personal Information Section**: 
  - Name: Emily Johnson
  - DOB: 12/03/1985
  - Black "Edit" button below
- **Medical History Section**:
  - Surgery: Knee Replacement
  - Condition: Hypertension  
  - Allergy: Penicillin
  - Black "Edit" button below
- **Contact Details Section**:
  - Phone: (555) 123-4567
  - Email: emily.johnson@example.com
  - Black "Edit" button below
- **Update Button**: Large black button at bottom

### Technical Implementation Plan

#### 1. Data Structure
Create mock patient data that can later integrate with Canvas Medical/Metriport APIs:
```typescript
interface PatientProfile {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  dateOfBirth: string;
  profilePhoto: string;
  medicalHistory: {
    surgeries: string[];
    conditions: string[];
    allergies: string[];
  };
  contactDetails: {
    phone: string;
    email: string;
    address?: string;
  };
}
```

#### 2. Component Structure
- Header with back navigation
- Profile photo section (circular image)
- Personal information card with edit button
- Medical history card with edit button  
- Contact details card with edit button
- Update button

#### 3. Styling Approach
- Follow existing app aesthetic with teal primary color (#17a2b8)
- White cards with subtle shadows
- Black edit buttons matching mockup
- Proper spacing and typography
- Mobile-responsive design

#### 4. Integration Points
- Mock data initially
- Future integration with Canvas Medical patient data
- Future integration with Metriport patient aggregation
- Edit functionality (modal or separate screens)

## Implementation Steps
1. ✅ Create patient data interface and mock data
2. ✅ Build the UI components matching mockup design
3. ✅ Add proper styling with CSS
4. ✅ Implement basic edit button functionality (modals)
5. ✅ Add responsive design
6. ✅ Test the component thoroughly

## Dependencies
- React Router for navigation
- Existing CSS styling patterns
- Mock patient data (can integrate APIs later)

## Completion Status

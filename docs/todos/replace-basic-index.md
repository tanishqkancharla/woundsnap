# Replace Basic Index.tsx with Proper App Structure

## Current State
The current index.tsx is a minimal boilerplate with:
- Basic React/ReactDOM setup
- Simple "Hi! 2+2=4" display
- Manual DOM container creation

## Requirements Analysis

Based on TODO.md and Woundsnap.md, the app needs:

### Core Screens Required:
1. **WelcomeScreen** - onboarding and permissions
2. **LoginScreen** - Canvas Medical OAuth
3. **Dashboard** - main navigation hub
4. **PhotoCapture** - camera with wound guides
5. **WoundInformationForm** - detailed wound data entry
6. **TreatmentPlan** - care instructions
7. **PatientProfile** - historical data
8. **FollowUpReminders** - scheduling
9. **ClinicianVerification** - provider workflow
10. **Settings** - app preferences
11. **SupportFAQs** - help docs

### App Structure Needs:
- **React Router** for navigation (already installed)
- **Authentication state management** (Canvas OAuth)
- **API client setup** (Axios already installed)
- **Proper React 17 patterns** (based on package.json)

### User Flow from Woundsnap.md:
1. Patient opens app
2. Taps "upload picture of wound"
3. Search/add patient injury for history
4. Camera screen with "take picture" button
5. Loading state during AI processing
6. Analysis results screen with suggested actions
7. Previous wound logs display

## Proposed App Structure

```
src/
â”œâ”€â”€ index.tsx (entry point)
â”œâ”€â”€ App.tsx (main app component with routing)
â”œâ”€â”€ screens/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ WelcomeScreen.tsx
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ LoginScreen.tsx
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Dashboard.tsx
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ PhotoCapture.tsx
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ WoundInformationForm.tsx
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ TreatmentPlan.tsx
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ PatientProfile.tsx
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ FollowUpReminders.tsx
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ ClinicianVerification.tsx
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Settings.tsx
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ SupportFAQs.tsx
â”œâ”€â”€ components/ (shared components)
â”œâ”€â”€ services/ (API integrations)
â”œâ”€â”€ hooks/ (custom React hooks)
â”œâ”€â”€ utils/ (helper functions)
â””â”€â”€ types/ (TypeScript definitions)
```

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Basic App Shell
1. Create App.tsx with React Router setup
2. Create placeholder screen components  
3. Set up basic navigation structure
4. Update index.tsx to render App component

### Phase 2: Core Screens
1. Implement WelcomeScreen with permissions handling
2. Add basic Dashboard with navigation
3. Create PhotoCapture screen structure
4. Add remaining placeholder screens

### Phase 3: Integration Points
1. Set up service layer for API calls
2. Add authentication context
3. Create hooks for state management
4. Add TypeScript types

## Technical Considerations

- Use React 17 patterns (already in package.json)
- React Router DOM v6 (already installed)
- TypeScript strict mode (tsconfig.json)
- Mobile-first responsive design
- Progressive Web App capabilities

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Proper React app structure with routing
- [ ] All 11 core screens accessible
- [ ] Clean separation of concerns
- [ ] Mobile-responsive layout
- [ ] TypeScript compilation without errors
- [ ] Ready for API integration work

## Progress

### âœ… Completed Implementation

**Phase 1: Basic App Shell**
- âœ… Created App.tsx with React Router setup
- âœ… Set up basic navigation structure with all 11 routes
- âœ… Updated index.tsx to render App component instead of basic placeholder

**Phase 2: Core Screens**
- âœ… Implemented WelcomeScreen with proper navigation
- âœ… Created LoginScreen with Canvas OAuth placeholder
- âœ… Built comprehensive Dashboard with navigation hub
- âœ… Developed PhotoCapture screen with camera simulation and user flow
- âœ… Created WoundInformationForm with proper form handling
- âœ… Implemented TreatmentPlan with realistic AI analysis results display
- âœ… Added remaining placeholder screens: PatientProfile, FollowUpReminders, ClinicianVerification, Settings, SupportFAQs

**Technical Implementation:**
- âœ… Proper React 17 patterns maintained
- âœ… TypeScript strict mode compliance
- âœ… React Router DOM v6 navigation
- âœ… Mobile-responsive structure ready
- âœ… Build process verified (no TypeScript errors)
- âœ… Clean component separation and file organization

**User Flow Implementation:**
- âœ… Welcome â†’ Login â†’ Dashboard flow
- âœ… Dashboard â†’ Photo Capture â†’ Wound Form â†’ Treatment Plan flow  
- âœ… Complete navigation between all 11 core screens
- âœ… Back button navigation and proper routing

### âœ… Success Criteria Met

- âœ… Proper React app structure with routing
- âœ… All 11 core screens accessible via navigation
- âœ… Clean separation of concerns (screens, components, etc.)
- âœ… Mobile-responsive layout structure
- âœ… TypeScript compilation without errors
- âœ… Ready for API integration work (services layer structure prepared)

### ðŸŽ¯ Implementation Complete

The basic index.tsx has been successfully replaced with a complete React application structure. All core screens are implemented with proper navigation flow matching the clinical workflow described in Woundsnap.md. The app is now ready for API integrations and styling enhancements.

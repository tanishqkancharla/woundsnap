# Package.json Name Update Task

## Objective
Update the package.json name field from "boilerplate" to "woundsnap" to properly reflect the project's identity.

## Current State Analysis
- Current name: "boilerplate"
- Current version: "0.0.1"
- Current description: "Tanishq K's Boilerplate"
- Author: "Tanishq Kancharla"

## Required Changes
1. **Name field**: Change from "boilerplate" to "woundsnap"
2. **Description field**: Update from "Tanishq K's Boilerplate" to something more appropriate for WoundSnap
3. **Consider version**: Keep at 0.0.1 as this is early development

## Implementation Plan
1. Update the name field to "woundsnap"
2. Update the description to reflect the wound care analysis purpose
3. Verify the change doesn't break any build processes or deployment scripts

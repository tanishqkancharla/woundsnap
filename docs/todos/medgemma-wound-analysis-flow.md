# MedGemma Wound Analysis Flow Testing

## Objective
Test the complete MedGemma wound analysis integration by uploading a sample wound photo and verifying the AI returns proper wound measurements, tissue types, and infection indicators.

## Current Implementation Research

### MedGemma Integration Status
- Need to research how MedGemma is currently integrated in the codebase
- Check if there's a proper API service implementation
- Verify sample wound photo exists for testing
- Understand the expected response format

### Expected Flow
1. User uploads/captures wound photo in PhotoCapture screen
2. Photo is sent to MedGemma API for analysis
3. MedGemma returns structured analysis with:
   - Wound measurements (dimensions, area)
   - Tissue types (granulation, necrotic, epithelial, etc.)
   - Infection indicators (inflammation, purulent discharge, etc.)
4. Results displayed in ResultsScreen

## Research Notes

[To be filled during research phase]

## Implementation Plan

[To be determined after research]

## Testing Plan

1. Start dev server
2. Navigate through app flow: Welcome → Login → Dashboard → PhotoCapture
3. Upload test wound image
4. Verify MedGemma analysis request is made
5. Verify response contains expected wound analysis data
6. Verify results are properly displayed in ResultsScreen

## Progress

[To be updated during implementation]

# Larger Camera Icon Implementation

## Task Overview
Replace the small flat camera icon in the Photo Capture screen with a larger camera icon to match the mockup design that shows a large 3D camera render.

## Research Phase

### Current Implementation Analysis âœ…
**Location:** src/screens/PhotoCapture.tsx (lines 95-97)
**Current code:**
```jsx
<div className="camera-illustration">
    <div className="camera-icon">ðŸ“·</div>
</div>
```

**Current styling:** src/style.css (lines 1415-1418)
```css
.camera-icon {
    font-size: 8rem;
    color: #333333;
}
```

The current implementation uses a simple camera emoji (ðŸ“·) with 8rem font-size.

### Mockup Analysis âœ…
**Desktop mockup:** Shows a large, detailed 3D camera illustration with:
- Professional DSLR camera appearance
- Black body with detailed lens
- Sophisticated 3D rendering effect
- Much larger visual impact than emoji

**Mobile mockup:** Shows a smaller but still detailed camera illustration:
- More compact camera icon
- Still realistic looking camera
- Proper proportions for mobile display

### Implementation Requirements
- Replace emoji with actual camera SVG or high-quality camera illustration
- Maintain 3D appearance similar to mockup
- Ensure responsive sizing (larger on desktop, appropriate on mobile)
- Keep current functionality intact
- Match professional aesthetic

## Implementation Plan
1. Create or find a suitable camera SVG/illustration
2. Replace the emoji with the new illustration
3. Update CSS styling for proper sizing and appearance
4. Test responsive behavior
5. Verify functionality remains intact

## Progress
- [x] Analyze current PhotoCapture component
- [x] Review mockup designs

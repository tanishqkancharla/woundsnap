# Add Edit Buttons for Patient Profile Sections

**Task:** Add Edit buttons for each section (Personal Info, Medical History, Contact Details) in PatientProfile screen
**Priority:** Medium
**Status:** In Progress

## Research Findings

The [`PatientProfile.tsx`](file:///Users/tanishqkancharla/Documents/Projects/woundsnap/src/screens/PatientProfile.tsx) component already has a well-implemented structure with:

1. **Current Implementation:**
   - Three sections: Personal Information, Medical History, Contact Details
   - Each section already has an "Edit" button that triggers `handleEditClick()`
   - Basic modal overlay system in place with `showEditModal` state
   - Proper styling for buttons and modal in [`style.css`](file:///Users/tanishqkancharla/Documents/Projects/woundsnap/src/style.css#L1835-L1941)

2. **Current Functionality:**
   - Edit buttons exist and are properly styled (black buttons matching mockup)
   - Modal opens when clicking edit buttons
   - Modal has placeholder content with Cancel/Save buttons
   - Console logging for debugging

3. **Gap Analysis:**
   The TODO item states "no functionality" but this appears to be incorrect. The edit buttons are already implemented and functional. They:
   - Exist for all three sections (Personal Info, Medical History, Contact Details)
   - Have proper black styling matching the mockup design
   - Open modals when clicked
   - Have basic modal structure with Cancel/Save actions

## Specification

Upon closer examination, the edit buttons are already fully implemented and functional. However, I will enhance the functionality to make the modals more complete:

### Current State
- ✅ Edit buttons present for all sections
- ✅ Modal system implemented
- ✅ Proper styling (black buttons)
- ✅ Click handlers working

### Enhancement Plan
1. **Improve Modal Content:** Add actual form fields for editing data
2. **Implement Save Functionality:** Make the Save button functional
3. **Data Validation:** Add basic form validation
4. **State Management:** Update patient data when saved

## Implementation

The task appears to be already completed based on the current implementation. The edit buttons exist and function as expected. However, I will enhance the modal content to make the editing experience more complete.

## Testing Plan

1. Navigate to Patient Profile screen
2. Verify Edit buttons are visible for all three sections
3. Click each Edit button and verify modal opens
4. Test modal functionality (Cancel/Save buttons)
5. Verify styling matches mockup design

## Implementation Results

**DISCOVERY:** The edit buttons were already fully implemented and functional. The TODO item appeared to have incorrect information stating "no functionality" when the buttons were actually working.

**ENHANCEMENTS MADE:**
1. **Enhanced Modal Content:** Replaced placeholder text with actual form fields for each section
2. **Implemented Save Functionality:** Made Save buttons functional with proper state management
3. **Added Form Fields:**
   - Personal Info: Name, Date of Birth
   - Medical History: Surgeries, Conditions, Allergies (comma-separated)
   - Contact Details: Phone, Email, Address
4. **Form Styling:** Added professional form styling with focus states and proper spacing
5. **Data Persistence:** Form data properly updates the patient state and reflects in the UI

## Progress

- [x] Research existing implementation
- [x] Identify current functionality  
- [x] Analyze gap between current and expected functionality
- [x] Enhance modal content with actual form fields
- [x] Implement save functionality
- [x] Add form styling and validation
- [x] Test enhanced functionality with Playwright

## Testing Results

All three edit buttons work perfectly:
- ✅ Personal Information edit button - opens modal, saves data correctly
- ✅ Medical History edit button - opens modal, handles comma-separated lists properly  
- ✅ Contact Details edit button - opens modal, saves phone/email updates correctly
- ✅ Cancel functionality works for all sections
- ✅ Data persists and updates in UI after save
- ✅ Form fields properly populated with existing data
- ✅ Professional styling matches app aesthetic

**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED - All edit functionality is now fully implemented and tested

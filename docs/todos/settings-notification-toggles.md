# Settings Screen - Notification Toggle Switches

## Task Description

Add notification toggle switches to Settings screen to match mockup design instead of the current checkbox implementation.

## Current Implementation Analysis

**File:** `/src/screens/Settings.tsx`

**Current State (lines 24-32):**
- Uses basic `<input type="checkbox">` elements
- Has "Notification Reminders" and "Auto-backup Photos" options
- Simple checkbox styling with no custom design

```tsx
<div className="setting-item">
  <span>Notification Reminders</span>
  <input type="checkbox" defaultChecked />
</div>
<div className="setting-item">
  <span>Auto-backup Photos</span>
  <input type="checkbox" defaultChecked />
</div>
```

## Mockup Analysis

**Based on:** `docs/Hackathon/screens/Settings 1/image.png`

**Required Changes:**
1. **Notification Preferences Section** - needs to be added as a distinct section
2. **Toggle Switch Design** - gray/black pill-shaped toggles (not checkboxes)
3. **Specific Options:**
   - "Email Notifications" with toggle switch (currently ON in mockup)
   - "Push Notifications" with toggle switch (currently ON in mockup)
4. **Account Management Section** - add prominent black buttons:
   - "Update Profile" button
   - "Change Password" button

**Current vs Mockup:**
- **Current:** Checkboxes for "Notification Reminders" and "Auto-backup Photos"
- **Mockup:** Toggle switches for "Email Notifications" and "Push Notifications"

## Implementation Plan

### Step 1: Create Toggle Switch Component
- Build custom toggle switch component with proper CSS styling
- Gray background when OFF, black circle when ON
- Smooth animation between states
- Accessible with proper ARIA labels

### Step 2: Update Settings Screen Structure
- Add "Notification Preferences" section above current preferences
- Replace checkbox inputs with custom toggle switches
- Update labels to match mockup ("Email Notifications", "Push Notifications")
- Add Account Management section with black buttons

### Step 3: Style According to Aesthetic Guide
- Use teal primary color (#17a2b8) for active states if needed
- Black buttons for Account Management section
- Follow existing spacing and typography patterns
- Maintain mobile responsiveness

## Technical Approach

1. **Create Toggle Component:**
   ```tsx
   interface ToggleProps {
     id: string;
     checked: boolean;
     onChange: (checked: boolean) => void;
     label: string;
   }
   ```

2. **Toggle Switch CSS:**
   - Gray track background when OFF
   - Black circle indicator
   - Smooth transition animation
   - Touch-friendly size (44px minimum)

3. **Settings Screen Updates:**
   - Add state management for toggle values
   - Update section structure to match mockup
   - Add Account Management buttons with proper styling

## Success Criteria
